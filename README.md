# Criteria A: Planning

## Problem definition

Ms. Sato is a local trader who is interested in the emerging market of cryptocurrencies. She has started to buy and sell electronic currencies, however at the moment she is tracking all his transaction using a ledger in a spreadsheet which is starting to become burdensome and too disorganized. It is also difficult for Ms Sato to find past transactions or important statistics about the currency. Ms Sato is in need of a digital ledger that helps her track the amount of the cryptocurrency, the transactions, along with useful statistics. 

Apart for this requirements, Ms Sato is open to explore a cryptocurrency selected by the developer.

## Proposed Solution

Design statement:
I will to design and make a electronic ledger for Ms. Sato. The digital crypto ledger will use ETH or ethernium crypto currency and is constructed using the software Python . It will take a few weeks to make and will be evaluated according to the criteria listed below.

Eth or etherium is a popular cryptocurrency in the modern crypto market. It is one of the leading technologies in Defi or decentralized finance. 
Its speed for transactions, Dis-inflationary supply, and scalability to various aspects in fiance and tech make it so wanted

## Success Criteria
1. The electronic ledger is a text-based software (Runs in the Terminal).
2. The electronic ledger display the basic description of the cyrptocurrency selected.
3. The electronic ledger allows to enter, withdraw and record transactions.
4. The electronic ledger will display past trasactions
5. The electronic ledger should show (to be defined) statistisc some of which may be in a bar graph terminal format.
6. The electronic ledger will have password to enter this
